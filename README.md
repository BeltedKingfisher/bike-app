# Bike App

## Description

I created an interactive bicycle manual for beginners.  My app allows the user to interact with different parts of a bicycle and learn the vocabulary and variations of components. It features:
* An interactive map of a bicycle and a dropdown menu for different bike types
* An intuitive navigation sidebar
* A list of St. Louis based bicycle shops (screened by me as a female-bodied person)
* A Contact form

## Languages and Technologies

This project was built with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, JSX, Jest, and Bootstrap 4.0. It uses the API call to JSONBin, which I built to house my research findings for the information displayed about bicycles.

## Future Features

* More labeled components
* An alternative to the current pointer event that is browser-specific
* Find different images that match the bike frame selected from the dropdown
